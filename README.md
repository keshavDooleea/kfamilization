# KFamilization

### Stack

- Frontend (React.js - Typescript)
- Backend (Flask API, SQL Lite - Python)

### Reason for choosing React.js over Next.js although the latter (Next.js) offers the whole bundle such as REST API integrated configuration, routes structure, SSR, ...

- Next.js makes the whole process 2x easier, so I wanted to use mainly Python/Flask as Backend for new learning purposes.

### Git submodules

Both frontend and backend applications are two seperate git private repositories which were combined into this one as Git submodules.
